# Security Policy

We take security seriously and want vulnerability reports handled quickly and privately.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest `main` branch and its deployments are supported with security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

1. **Do not open a public issue.**
2. Send a private report via a GitHub Security Advisory (preferred) or email `security@project-apex.io`.
3. Include reproduction steps, affected endpoints or files, and any proof of concept.

You will receive an acknowledgement within 3 business days and status updates until resolution.

## Disclosure

- Please keep reports confidential until a fix is released.
- We will credit researchers in release notes if desired.
